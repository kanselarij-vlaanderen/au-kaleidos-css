# AU Kaleidos SCSS

AU Kaleidos SCSS as a separate package.

This package consists of 2 SCSS files.

The standalone file is built upon publishing to npm.

## Note on source files

The `au2-kaleidos.scss` file is meant to be imported into a larger codebase, where global variables (like the colors included in this package) are maintained globally.
