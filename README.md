**⚠️ au-kaleidos-css, as a repository, has reached end of life and is mostly superseded by the styling (SCSS, CSS, variables, etc.) provided within [`@appuniversum/ember-appuniversum`](https://github.com/appuniversum/ember-appuniversum). We are no longer accepting pull requests or providing support for users.**

**For additional information or requests, we refer to the [deprecation message](https://github.com/kanselarij-vlaanderen/au-kaleidos-css/issues/13).**

AU Kaleidos SCSS as a separate package.

This package consists of 2 SCSS files.

* auk-base.scss
* auk-components.scss

Both need to be loaded to have complete CSS.
